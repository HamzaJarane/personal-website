However, in PHP, they are less discussed but equally useful in certain scenarios. Let’s dive into what self-invoking functions are, how they work in PHP, and why you might use them"

# Self-Invoking Functions in PHP

A self-invoking function is a function that is executed immediately after it is defined. This pattern can be used to encapsulate logic, avoid polluting the global namespace, or execute initialization code in a clean and structured way.

### Syntax

In PHP, self-invoking functions are implemented using anonymous functions (closures). Here is the basic syntax:

```php
(function() {
    // Your code here
    echo "Hello, World!";
})();
```

### How It Works

1. An anonymous function is defined using the `function` keyword.
2. The function is immediately followed by parentheses `()` to invoke it.
3. The code inside the function is executed right away.

### Example
If you need temporary logic that doesn’t need to persist, a self-invoking function is a great fit:

```php
$result = (function() {
    $a = 5;
    $b = 10;
    return $a + $b;
})();

echo "The result is: $result";
```
