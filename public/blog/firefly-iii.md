### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
- A server or VPS with Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A domain name (optional, but recommended)
- Basic knowledge of the terminal

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Docker Compose File
Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.3'

services:
  fireflyiii:
    image: fireflyiii/core:latest
    container_name: fireflyiii
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - APP_KEY=base64:YOUR_GENERATED_APP_KEY
      - DB_CONNECTION=mysql
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_PORT=3306
      - DB_DATABASE=firefly
      - DB_USERNAME=firefly
      - DB_PASSWORD=secret
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
    volumes:
      - firefly_upload:/var/www/html/storage/upload

  db:
    image: mariadb
    container_name: fireflyiiidb
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=firefly
      - MYSQL_USER=firefly
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpass
    volumes:
      - firefly_db:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  firefly_upload:
  firefly_db:
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate APP_KEY
Use the Laravel command to generate an APP_KEY:
```bash
docker run --rm fireflyiii/core php artisan key:generate --show
```
Replace `YOUR_GENERATED_APP_KEY` in the compose file with the key from the output.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Containers

Once the containers are up, Firefly III should be available at `http://localhost:8080` or your domain if configured.
